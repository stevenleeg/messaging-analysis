# Messaging Analysis
This repo contains the script/queries I used to generate an analysis of a
instant messaging survey I sent out to friends on Facebook. I totally recognize
that this is _way_ overkill, but somehow I found this less frustrating than
trying to figure out how to generate these numbers in a spreadsheet. Yikes...

The results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ex1IAoqcoMfL9sopy99C02r8xYA7rGFFA1qCzk29xts/edit?usp=sharing).
